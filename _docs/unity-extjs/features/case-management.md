# Overview

## Case 

Case is a basic concept in Case Management. 
A case is an abstraction over the case entity from any supported Case Management platforms. 
It is a container that provides the case data, related documents, business processing, and routing to the case workers.  

A case is an instance of a case type. Case Management solution can contain one or more related case types. 
Each case type defines the tasks, the task steps (work items), and the roles that must complete those steps to solve a business problem. 
The case type also includes properties that are displayed to case workers in case views.

## Tasks

A case contains tasks. A task represents a specific activity that is performed as part of a case. 

## Work Items

The task consists of one or more work items. 
Work items are the actions in a process that must be completed for a task.

## UCM/ICM Workbaskets

UCM/ICM workbaskets represent the list of cases or work items which are logically grouped by
certain criteria. From the business perspective work baskets can be personal or public.

Personal work basket contains work items for tasks that are assigned to a specific user. 

Public work basket contains work items that are assigned to a role, but not to a specific
person. Work items in a public work basket can be accepted by any user to work on.
