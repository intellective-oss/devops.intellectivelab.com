[![unity-wheel-diagram](overview/images/Wheel-Diagram-Business-Applications-475x445.png)](overview/images/Wheel-Diagram-Business-Applications-1024x959.png)  

Unity connects your business application users with multiple repositories, workflows, and content systems.

Unity empowers users to seamlessly search for and manage documents, tasks, and data across multiple ECM and BPM systems, whether on-premises or cloud, right from within your business applications. The solution integrates out of the box, allowing you to access and manipulate documents and data, manage cases, and process tasks directly from CRM and in-house business applications.

Unity provides: 
- A seamless, rich, and contextual view of your enterprise content and data from multiple enterprise systems and business applications 
- Advanced document management, case management, and task processing across multiple ECM and BPM systems in one central location 
- Enhanced user engagement and productivity 
- Informed business decisions based on complete data from all your enterprise systems and applications 
- Improved business KPIs via process automation and insights 

Unity implements quickly, reduces costs, and improves data security.

## Simple to use

## Quick to deploy
Design UI and make it available in minutes. 
## Secure
Use role-based security combined with your in-house authentication to ensure appropriate access to content and system. 
## Reduces costs

# Unity Features and Components

## Content management

- Real-time search against variety of data sources using repository-specific connectors
- Users can receive, review and process tasks from number of workflows and case management platforms
- Unity can mix cases from different systems in the same view
- Users can access data from legacy systems or display Unity components in CRM and enterprise systems 
- CRUD operations available out of the box + ability to create custom actions

## Process and case management

- Unity Case Management UI components (Workbasket, Case View, Audit, etc) are abstracted from a case model via a set of REST services and pluggable connectors
- IBM Case Manager, legacy BPF and jBPM models are supported OOTB   
- Support for other BPM and Case Management systems can be added via additional connectors 

## Enterprise search

Unity Enterprise search crawls, merges, transforms, and serves content from different business systems into a single high-performance analytics index. Crawl can be near-real time, periodic, and on-demand in response to source system events.     

Unity Enterprise search is:
- A set of crawlers to intelligently pull information from data sources, such as content systems, BPM systems, or databases 
- A transform capability to perform actions like altering incoming data, merging data from multiple systems, and applying additional information or intelligence to data such as security information
- A high performance Solr index that provides features like faceted search and fuzzy search, as well as high scalability and fault tolerance
- A search architecture to serve the index data to the Unity UI front end, or to other search applications

Users can search for content and data in a variety of ways:
- Quick search
- Simple and advanced criteria search
- Template-based search
- Full-text and fuzzy search

## Actionable analytics 

Users can get reports (including various charts and graphs) for case tasks and apply actions directly from the report view.  

## Integration

Intellective Unity is designed with integration in mind and can be used as a service (REST/JSON API), as UI component (React) and URL Integration.
External applications can consume data or embed Intellective Unity UI components in various technologies:
- ASPX Custom Applications
- Portals
- IBM Content Navigator
- Line of Business Applications
- Cloud Applications 

Unity provides integration with Salesforce and Dynamics OOTB.

## Low code/ no code

System analysts can configure all aspects of the interface and integrated applications, including:  
- What each tab in the system looks like
- What features are available
- What content user groups can access
- What actions user can take

The Configuration Console allows managing most of Unity components from a single interface.
