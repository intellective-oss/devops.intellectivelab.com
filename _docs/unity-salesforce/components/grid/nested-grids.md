# Overview

This feature allows to show cases with workitems as their nested elements in a result grid:

![sf-nested-grids](nested-grids/images/sf-nested-grids.png)
 
It supports lazy loading: all children nodes are empty in the beginning and when user clicks on the expand button, nested workitems load along with workitem columns which can not hidden.   
Expanded cases can be collapsed so that workitems no longer shown in the grid.

# Configuration
