# Introduction

Unity for SharePoint provides an advanced user interface allowing users to search, organize, and transact on content stored across multiple SharePoint Sites more efficiently. It extends and expands the search features of SharePoint to a more granular level, giving the user the ability to quickly access more refined search results.  

Searching in SharePoint is limited to a single field, and often returns too much content that cannot be refined. With Unity for SharePoint, a user can: 
- Refine their search criteria using separate fields for Document Title and Document Content, and 
- Refine the Operator to use OR (Default behavior to match SharePoint) or AND. 

SharePoint provides the capability to search across the Entire Organization (All SharePoint Sites) or select a Specific SharePoint Site, and does not allow sorting of results, which can either provide either a too broad, or too narrow search window.  With Unity for SharePoint a user can: 

- Select Multiple SharePoint Sites: without having to select All SharePoint Sites to perform a more refined search. 
- Customize which search result columns to display or hide and control the order. 
- Sort on one more of the search result columns and control the sort order. 
- Access Custom Metadata fields configured by an administrator to leverage in Search Criteria or Results.


SharePoint does not provide a capability to Save Content as Favorite or Save Search Criteria.  With Unity for SharePoint a user can: 

- Indicate a Document as a Favorite and view a list of Favorites.  Favorites are displayed by default on Log In.   
- Save Search Criteria as a Saved Search, and access Saved Searches to quickly execute the search without re-entering the Search Criteria.
