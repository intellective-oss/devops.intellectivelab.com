# What is Unity

Unity is a set of integrated components that provide an innovative, enterprise-class solution for accessing, updating, and consolidating content and data from multiple repositories using a single interface configurable to meet your business needs.

Unity connects your business application users with multiple repositories, workflows, and content systems.

Unity empowers users to seamlessly search for and manage documents, tasks, and data across multiple ECM and BPM systems, whether on-premises or cloud, right from within your business applications. 
The solution integrates out of the box, allowing you to access and manipulate documents and data, manage cases, and process tasks directly from CRM and in-house business applications.

Unity provides: 
- A seamless, rich, and contextual view of your enterprise content and data from multiple enterprise systems and business applications 
- Advanced document management, case management, and task processing across multiple ECM and BPM systems in one central location 
- Enhanced user engagement and productivity 
- Informed business decisions based on complete data from all your enterprise systems and applications 
- Improved business KPIs via process automation and insights 

Unity implements quickly, reduces costs, and improves data security.

# Architecture Principles

## Open standards

- Based on Java/J2EE standard technologies
- Run in J2EE Web Application Container
- Modern  JavaScript frameworks for rich user experience
- Apache Lucene or SOLR for Enterprise Search component
- CMIS 1.1 specification support for a wide range of external systems

## Enterprise ready

- Real-world tested by some of the largest companies in the world
- Global deployments, high transaction rate, high volumes, large number of users
- Exceptional scalability via standard J2EE technologies and techniques 
- Variety of deployment options

# Unity Features and Components

## Content management

- Real-time search against variety of data sources using repository-specific connectors
- Users can receive, review and process tasks from number of workflows and case management platforms
- Unity can mix cases from different systems in the same view
- Users can access data from legacy systems or display Unity components in CRM and enterprise systems 
- CRUD operations available out of the box + ability to create custom actions

## Process and case management

- Unity Case Management UI components (Workbasket, Case View, Audit, etc) are abstracted from a case model via a set of REST services and pluggable connectors
- IBM Case Manager, legacy BPF and jBPM models are supported OOTB   
- Support for other BPM and Case Management systems can be added via additional connectors 

## Connectors

Unity Connector is a unified facade to integrate content from different external sources:

- IBM Content Manager On Demand (CMOD)
- IBM Content Manager (CM8)
- IBM Case Manager (ICM)
- IBM FileNet P8 CE
- Alfresco, Sharepoint, etc (CMIS)
- Database
- JNDI
- Box (Cloud)
- Red Hat Process Automation Manager (jBPM)

## Enterprise search

Unity Enterprise search crawls, merges, transforms, and serves content from different business systems into a single high-performance analytics index. 
Crawl can be near-real time, periodic, and on-demand in response to source system events.     

Unity Enterprise search is:
- A set of crawlers to intelligently pull information from data sources, such as content systems, BPM systems, or databases 
- A transform capability to perform actions like altering incoming data, merging data from multiple systems, and applying additional information or intelligence to data such as security information
- A high performance Solr index that provides features like faceted search and fuzzy search, as well as high scalability and fault tolerance
- A search architecture to serve the index data to the Unity UI front end, or to other search applications

Users can search for content and data in a variety of ways:
- Quick search
- Simple and advanced criteria search
- Template-based search
- Full-text and fuzzy search

## Security

Use role-based security combined with your in-house authentication to ensure appropriate access to content and system. 

### Authentication

- JAAS based authentication to popular LDAP providers
- Single Sign On Support
- Extensible via custom plug-ins
- Users are stored in external Authentication Providers
- Access can be granted/denied on group level

### Authorization

- Role-based access to features, functions, actions, data, and content
- Authorization could be done against LDAP, standard/custom Entitlement Systems and Systems of Record
- Roles/entitlements configured in Unity to control all aspects of the system: UI elements, action lists, pick lists, search templates, searches, result sets

### Data Access

Repository security is fully supported for search and retrieval. Supports user/group mapping and direct security integration.

- Search criteria could be re-defined based on user access level
- Search results could be filtered based on user access level
- Actions could be audited with records stored in a database or another data source

## Actionable analytics

[![analytics](unity-overview/images/analytics-308x280.png)](unity-overview/images/analytics-770x701.png)  

Users can get interactive real-time reports (including various charts and graphs) for case tasks and apply actions directly from the report view.  

## Integration

Intellective Unity is designed with integration in mind and can be used as a service (REST/JSON API), as UI component (React) and URL Integration.
External applications can consume data or embed Intellective Unity UI components in various technologies:
- ASPX Custom Applications
- Portals
- IBM Content Navigator
- Line of Business Applications
- Cloud Applications 

Unity provides integration with Salesforce and Dynamics OOTB.

## Low code/ no code configuration

System analysts can configure all aspects of the interface and integrated applications, including:  
- What each tab in the system looks like
- What features are available
- What content user groups can access
- What actions user can take

Configuration XML-based and controls all aspects of the system.  
The Configuration Console allows managing most of Unity components from a single interface. 

## Interchange

Interchange is a complimentary product that works behind the scenes to give users of Unity actionable access to old and new business systems without impacting anybodyâ€™s experience.
