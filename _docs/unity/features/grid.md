# Multiple Column Sorting

You can configure the default Grid to allow multiple columns to be sorted at a time within the content list.

To use a multiple column sorting grid, click the header of a column. The grid sorts to that column (toggling between ascending or descending), and a number (1) appears next to that header. This number indicates that column is the primary sort column.  

To sort by a second column, click the header for another column. The grid sorts to that column (toggling between ascending or descending) while maintaining the sorting of the primary sort column, and a number (2) appears next to that header. This number indicates the column is the secondary sort column.

Continue until you reach the max number of sort columns (3 by default):
