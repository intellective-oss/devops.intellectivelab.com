Each user comment row has delete icon button on the right bottom corner:

![Delete comment](case-user-comments/images/delete-comment.png)

If user doesn't have enough permissions, this button will be shown as disabled.

To remove the comment click on that button and confirm deletion by choosing `Yes` on modal dialog:

![Delete comment confirmation](case-user-comments/images/delete-comment-confirmation.png)

It will lead to comment deletion and grid refresh.

`Cancel` button is intended for action cancellation.

Action appears automatically, no configuration is required.
