# RecentViewHistoryLocalStorage

Recent view history saves and shows links to recently viewed workitems:

History titles are different for different grids, depending on their content. Usually it's just a title of workitem,
but for some grids it can be other workitem parameter or even be composed of several parameters like it used by Workitems grid. 

It uses composed value of case title and own title for better readability and uniqueness:
