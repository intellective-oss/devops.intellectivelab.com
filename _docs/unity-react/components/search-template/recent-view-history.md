like on Workitems grid:

History titles are different for different grids, depending on their content. Usually it's just a title of an item,
but for some grids it can be other item parameter or even be composed of several parameters like it used by Workitems grid. 

It composes case title parameter value and own title parameter for better readability and uniqueness:
