The Public Unity [REST API](references.md#rest-overview) gives you access to document, case, workflow, search, and design resources through a REST API. Using this API, it's possible to locate, update, and delete content as well as manage workflows. The API also provides a common interface to document repositories, data sources, and case management systems, which can be changed on the server with no changes needed in the client application that consumes the API.
