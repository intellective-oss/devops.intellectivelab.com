Each user comment row has `Delete` icon button on the right bottom corner:

![Delete comment](history-comments-tab/images/delete-comment.png)

If user doesn't have enough permissions, this button will be shown as disabled.

To remove the comment click on that button and confirm deletion by choosing `Yes` on modal dialog:

![Delete comment confirmation](history-comments-tab/images/delete-comment-confirmation.png)

It will lead to comment deletion and grid refresh.

`Cancel` button is intended for action cancellation.
