    You will see a page almost how it will look on doc portal, images are shown and links work, but navigation tree and table of contents are not shown and styling may differ. 
    
- Check the files do not contain confidential information like passwords, customer data etc  
- To add a comment on `Files changed` tab click `+` sign near row number, it appears when hovering mouse on the row:

- To approve PR use `Review changes` button:

    ![Approve](how-to-review-pull-request/images/approve.png)
    
    You can comment PR or request changes instead.
