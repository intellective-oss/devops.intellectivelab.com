# Description

`Open case by URL` action provides an alternative way to open the case for viewing or editing.

# How to Open a Case by URL

`Open case by URL` action in React UI is implemented as a grid row action available via a grid's context menu:

![open-case-by-url](open-case-by-url/images/open-case-by-url1.png)

Once selected, a new browser tab will be opened by URL, which is provided in action configuration.

An example of using this feature can be opening a case from the React UI grid in the ExtJS UI:

![open-case-by-url](open-case-by-url/images/open-case-by-url2.png)

# Configuration
