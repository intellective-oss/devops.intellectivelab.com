Unity Enterprise search crawls, merges, transforms, and serves content from different business systems into a single high-performance analytics index. 
Crawl can be near-real time, periodic, and on-demand in response to source system events.     

Users can search for content and data in a variety of ways:
- [Quick search](../components/search-template/quick-search)
- Simple and advanced criteria search
- Template-based search
- Full-text and fuzzy search

*content to be added*
