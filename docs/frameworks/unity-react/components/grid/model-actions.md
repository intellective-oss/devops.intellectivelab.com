Model actions are actions, which are supposed to create the resource, e.g. a document or a case. By default, it is an action with `create` or `attach` type.

To invoke model action click on the appropriate button in the grid toolbar: 

![react_model-action](model-actions/images/gridmodelaction_1.png) 

Choosing an action targets to show configured view and pass some declared resource by actual `Uri` property, defined in an appropriate action from the list of all actions.

Examples of model actions:

- [Create a document action](../../features/document-management/create-document)  
- [Create a case action](../../features/case-management/create-case)
