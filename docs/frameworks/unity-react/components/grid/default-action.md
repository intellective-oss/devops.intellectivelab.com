By default, when user clicks on `link` column in the table view or selects item by clicking on it in the list view, the `view details` action will be executed and resource detail form opens.
However, this behaviour can be changed by enabling default action in the grid configuration. For example default action can be set to `view content` for document resources or `open in separate browser tab` for cases.
